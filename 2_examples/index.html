	<p>The troopers' most distinctive equipment is their white battle armor, inherited from their time as clone troopers. The complete armor set completely encases the body and typically has no individually distinguishing marking (in contrast to the clone trooper armor, which typically had various colorings to denote rank or unit, Stormtrooper armor has no rank affiliation).</p>
	
	<p>Liz Moore and Nick Pemberton sculpted designs for the helmet. Their designs were based on conceptual drawings by Ralph McQuarrie. The armor pieces of the costume were also designed from conceptual drawings by Ralph McQuarrie. Brian Muir, who was also responsible for sculpting Darth Vader, sculpted armor pieces for the stormtrooper costume in the Art Department at Elstree Studios. The suit was moulded and initially cast in plaster. Then Brian sharpened the detail at the plaster stage. The plaster casts were then remolded and cast in fibreglass to use as the "tools" for vacuum forming process. Suits were produced in house by Tashy Baines, the resident vacuum former, but then a problem developed with the machine. <a href="http://www.starfortressproductions.com/swempireclonetroopers.html">More cloning around...</a></p>

	<p>To write about the design of the Lotus Esprit one must know Giorgetto Giugiaro. He is regarded as one of the greatest Automotive Designers of the 20th century. He has designed cars since the late 1950s and was responsible for the design of the Lotus Esprit. Born on 1938 in North West Italy, his father was an artist and his grandfather painted church frescoes. So he trained as an Artist too. After moving to Turin, Giugiaro switched from being an artist to a Technical Design. At the age of 17, he started working at the Italian motor company Fiat, working in the Design Department. However, he found it difficult growing within the company. So, in December 1959, he moved jobs, to the Bertone styling studio and became Head of Design. In 1965, after six years, he join the management of Ghia. It was there he designed his first masterpiece, the De Tomaso Mangusta. This car was a turning point in car design, with smooth and clean lines.</p> 
	
	<p>In 1972 Giugiaro designed the Lotus Esprit. He used the Porsche Tapiro as a template to design the Esprit, tracing over the Tapiro. We thank you for bringing inspiration to the automotive industry and its influence today. <a href="http://www.lotusespritturbo.com">Drive on...</a></p>

	<h6>Dazzling from a distance</h6>
	
	<div class="imgshadow"> 
	
	<img src="../img/example_dazzle.jpg" alt="Dazzle Designs">
	
	</div>
	
	<p>Dazzle camouflage, also known as razzle dazzle or dazzle painting, was a family of ship camouflage used extensively in World War I and to a lesser extent in World War II and afterwards. Credited to artist Norman Wilkinson, though with a prior claim by the zoologist John Graham Kerr, it consisted of complex patterns of geometric shapes in contrasting colours, interrupting and intersecting each other.</p>

	<p>Unlike some other forms of camouflage, dazzle designs are not created to hide, but to confuse viewers with distance, size, etc. Dazzle was adopted by the British Admiralty and the U.S. Navy with little evaluation. Each ship's dazzle pattern was unique to avoid making classes of ships instantly recognisable to the enemy. The result was that a profusion of dazzle schemes were tried, and the evidence for their success was at best mixed. (but great job for trying a bold concept!) So many factors were involved that it was impossible to determine which were important, and whether any of the colour schemes were effective.</p>

	<p>Dazzle attracted the notice of artists, with Picasso notably claiming cubists had invented it. But who cares if the cubists designed it, it's always a collaborative effort.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dazzle_camouflage">Uncover more...</a></p>

	</div>
	
	<p>There's debate on whether this is a good example of function following form, but sometimes one aspects trumps another.</p>
	
	<p>Not all squeezers are actually meant to squeeze. Perhaps the most famous example of this is the Juicy Salif, designed by Philippe Starck in 1990. It is considered an icon of industrial design that has been displayed in New York's Museum of Modern Art. It is manufactured by Italian kitchenware company Alessi.</p>
	
	<p>As the founder of the company Alberto Alessi recalls <q>I received a napkin from Starck, on it among some incomprehensible marks (tomato sauce, in all likelihood) there were some sketches. Sketches of squid. They started on the left, and as they worked their way over to the right, they took on the unmistakable shape of what was to become the juicy salif. While eating a dish of squid and squeezing a lemon over it, Starck drew on the napkin his famous lemon squeezer.</q> <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/property/interiors/the-secret-history-of-philippe-starcks-lemon-squeezer-1972849.html">The Starck reality...</a></p>

	<p>We are a big fan (sorry for the pun) of Dyson. The desk fan is a mundane object, but they have transformed it into a product that looks great, cleans easily, removes any dangers of use, etc. The price point is high and the use of materials is a quality question. But it's simple. No need to say anymore. Great job!  <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/14/dyson-am06-desk-fan-10-review/">But can everyone afford one?...</a></p>

	<p>To be creative is often taking an idea from something else, from a completely different application, and applying it to a new problem. MINECRAFT is an example of an evolution and an end-game that's different from its inception. There's the digitized look and feel and the U/I and instructions are lacking, but there's something to a gaming product that allows the user to discover its function. <a href="http://www.wired.com/2013/11/minecraft-book/all/">Game on...</a></p>
